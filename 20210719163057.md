### [6.4. Use streaming IO interfaces](https://dave.cheney.net/high-performance-go-workshop/gophercon-2019.html#use_streaming_io_interfaces)

Where-ever possible avoid reading data into a`[]byte`and passing it around.

Depending on the request you may end up reading megabytes (or more!) of data into memory. This places huge pressure on the GC, which will increase the average latency of your application.

Instead use`io.Reader`and`io.Writer`to construct processing pipelines to cap the amount of memory in use per request.

For efficiency, consider implementing`io.ReaderFrom`/`io.WriterTo`if you use a lot of`io.Copy`. These interface are more efficient and avoid copying memory into a temporary buffer.

**io.ReaderFrom/io.WriteTo是什么意思，用法？**
